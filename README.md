# PeatlandProbability
The R scripts used in DeLancey et al., 2018.
The BRT optimization code in and experiment into the optimal parameters for the BRT model
  - optimal learning rate, tree complexity, and number of input varibles
  - number of training points
The Peatland probability script predicts peatland probablity across the boreal using the resul of the optimizations
